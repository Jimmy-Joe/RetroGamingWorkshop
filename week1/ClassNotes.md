# Session 1: Game Basics

In our First Project, we'll learn how to set up a basic Phaser Development and Testing environment.

## Setting up our development environment

We'll be using a remote environment on Cloud9 for our workshop activities.

There are three things about the game development framework and this workshop that makes us want to have a remote development environment for this workshop.

1. This framework requires a server. If we use a development environment that already has a server set up, we don't have to waste time setting it up, and if any of you have an issue, it's easier to debug because you're all using the same environment.
2. Whether you're on your mom's laptop, your own, or one you borrowed from us, the remote environment can be reached from any computer you can use. So you can get to it from a Chromebook at school, a desktop at home, whatever you have.

#### **Signing up for Cloud9**

Cloud9 (c9.io) offers an educational account which CoderDojo chapters can get. If you're another CoderDojo checking out this repository look into it. 

If you're in our CoderDojo, we need your email address to send you an invitation to set up an account and join our "team." We sent an email to you earlier and hopefully you've already accepted the invitation. If not, we'll have mentors in the class ready to send you one. We will budget 20 minutes for this in the workshop.

Students who took the Vim workshop will have these accounts already
