# Week 5 - Finishing Dojo Invaders

For my personal project, I chose the name "Alien Shootz."

Since last week, I've added:

- Scoring (including different scores for each alien)
- Dropping bombs (which you can shoot)
- Level and game resets (more on that soon)
- Collisions between the aliens/ship and bombs/ship
- Moving star field background

Things I brought back from our memory tones game:

- Game states
- A start/splash screen
- A "game over" screen

Things I'd have liked to do, but there wasn't time:

- Add bunkers
- Have bombs and missiles take pieces out of the bunkers
- Clean up the code a little more and improve the comments



So how do we go through this? File by file, feature by feature?
